The city's unique topography and coastal location result in microclimates, where weather conditions can vary significantly from one neighborhood to another. Average temperatures typically range from the mid-40s to the low 70s Fahrenheit (7-22 degrees Celsius), with the warmest months being September and October. Fog is a common occurrence, particularly in the summer, often rolling in during the evening and clearing by midday. Rainfall is most frequent from November to March, while the rest of the year is relatively dry. Wind is another constant factor, with the afternoon sea breeze being a defining feature of the city's weather. Despite these general patterns, it's always advisable to check the current weather forecast before planning activities in San Francisco, as conditions can change rapidly.\"}, log='Reached max steps.')"
